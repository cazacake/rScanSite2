  <br>Real questions from real people
  <br> FAQ:
  <ul>
    <li>How to use?
      <ul>
        <li>Enter a reddit username or the url of a reddit post and hit "scan user" or "scan post".
        </li>
        <li>Scanning time is currently 1-3 minutes for 150 users.
        </li>
        <li>Custom filters can be made for custom scans.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Is this censorship?
      <ul>
        <li>Nope, You're free to post whatever you want and this site can't stop you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Doesn't this discriminate against racists?
      <ul>
        <li>Yeah, Racism isn't cool and racists should be called out when they post racist things.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What if I troll racist subreddits?
      <ul>
        <li>It'll ignore you if you posted less than 2 times recently</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What if I used to participate in a hatesubreddit and have changed my ways?
      <ul>
        <li>It'll ignore you if you posted less than 2 times recently</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I found a racist, now what?
      <ul>
        <li>Call them out in the comments.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What does this accomplish?
      <ul>
        <li>Racists use Reddit to spread propaganda and indoctrinate new members.<br>
          It's a lot harder for them to spread propaganda when people immediately identify them as racists.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should make it so that racists can't say racist things.
      <ul>
        <li>Nah. Not possible from our end anyway, but if you want to fight facism take a screenshot<br>
           of a racist post on Reddit and post it on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or send it to the<br>
           local news to raise awareness of this issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A subreddit was accidentally marked as a hatesubreddit.
      <ul>
        <li>Make a post about it somewhere and I'll eventually find it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What about antifa/srs/hillary
      <ul>
        <li>Make a custom filter and scan for it yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Is supporting Donald Trump racist?
      <ul>
        <li>
          Not neccessarily, But participating in a subreddit that
          <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/75o7d9/when_buddhists_start_fighting_islam_you_know_the/">
        supports genocide</a> is.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This is why Trump won.
      <ul>
        <li>Calling out open racists offended them so much they voted for Trump out of spite. Mature.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I bet you don't even care about the jews. You just don't like facism for some reason.
